# esx_weashops_with_munitions

This is just a modified ESX_Weashops with included munitions inside the menu.

1. You must first add the included esx_clip into your resources / database / server.cfg
2. Add my weashops and change the locales to your language. (I changed them in en.lua / client.lua / server.lua in italian.)
4. BlackWeashop marker is hidden, but you change this deleting lines 157 and 163 in client.lua.
3. Enjoy
